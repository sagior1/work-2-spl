BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers
we implemented this bonus in a lot of methods, wherever we needed to use a configuration field we used the field instead of using numbers. for example we check the set size according to the feature size.
we didn't use any magic numbers and implemented all confugration fields. Also when changing the timer we used "final" fields representing each time needed. 
we used it in the following methods: Dealer constructor,Dealer run, timerloop, Dealer removeCardsFromTable, updateTimerDisplay,removeAllCardsFromTable, Dealer playerHasSet, Player constructor, Player run, point, penalty, Table constructor, table placeCard, table removeCard
we tested it by running the game many times each time changing different config making sure they work as needed

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

in the needed function we checked what is the configuration of the timer and implemented them accordingly
we implemented it in the following methods: timerloop, updateTimerDisplay, removeAllCardsFromTable, sleepUntillWokenUporTimeout
we tested it by using our own logs to check if the timer is updating correctly to the situation and that the cards in the table are being reshuffled when needed.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
